          <h3>Human Spaces</h3>
          <p>I’ve spent a lot of time designing things, and over the years I’ve become the “make the complex simple”
            guy.
            I have an intense drive to hone in on what’s important and cut out everything that isn’t. But anyone I work
            with will tell you I’m also full of contradictions. I love all the things about design that designers love.
            Form and function—order, symmetry, simplicity, aesthetic beauty, and usability. I'm drawn to tools that make
            sense and make life better. Aaaaaaand I'm also drawn to the off-kilter and weird. I love design that feels
            honest. Human. Design that makes me feel something, even if I'm not sure why.</p>

        <div class="instrument  col-lg-8 col-md-10 m-auto">
          <p>Somewhere along the path of designing our new office, a co-worker, Steve Denekas and I were talking about
            how
            the new space should feel, he (very loudly) said to me, “there is a difference between a creative-looking
            space and a space that fosters creativity”. He couldn't have been more accurate. In architecture mags or on
            Pinterest, you see a lot of creative-looking spaces. Spaces with clean lines, colorful furniture, lots of
            glass, and polished surfaces. Sparse rooms with great little plants and designer staplers are standard
            finds.
            These images are like candy to a designer, but looking a bit deeper, I wondered if they were environments
            that
            truly propelled creativity or innovation? Steve's realization struck me to the core, directly connecting to
            the yin and yang of my designer self. The part of me that wants to make things look and feel beautiful and
            human.</p>

            <p>Space is something to think of as an instrument for innovation and collaboration. It’s not something that
              should be accepted as-is. Space is a valuable tool that can help you create deep and meaningful
              collaborations in your work and life.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-4">Supporting the creative flow</h3>
          <p> This initial insight was the spark that I needed to start shaping our vision for the space. I started to
            envision a place that could be messy and filled with life. A place where nothing is too precious. Where
            visual texture can trigger an unexpected thought or insight. Where you could bump into someone and
            regardless of where you are, turn around, grab a pen and start collaborating.
          </p>
          <p>Questions began to surface. How can we create spaces that enable rapid idea generation and easy capture?
            Spaces that co-workers are compelled to personalize (individually or in groups). How can a space be designed
            to support our creative flow?
